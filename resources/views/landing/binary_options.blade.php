                <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>What is Binary Options trading?</strong></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">Also referred to as Digital Options, Binary Options became available as a method of
                    investing in the financial markets in 2008. It is a simple way that anyone can make money off
                    different financial markets. The mechanics of forex trading are accessible to both novice and expert
                    Forex traders. Today, forex have become very popular, with many people transitioning across from
                    Forex in a bid to derive profits from this unique and highly profitable trading vehicle.</p>
                <p><img src="images/binar_opt_01.html" alt="Binary Options" /></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">Trading forex simply involves making a prediction on the likely direction of
                    movement of an underlying asset. This could be a currency, index, commodity or stock. The trader
                    also has to choose a designated expiration time. When trading Binary Options, the trader does not
                    have to purchase the asset in itself. All that is required is for you to make a prediction regarding
                    the direction the asset will take over a certain period of time. &nbsp;With forex, there can only be
                    two potential&nbsp; outcomes&hellip; the only thing that matters is whether the prediction you have
                    made is right or wrong for the time frame you have chosen.</p>

                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pick the asset you wish to
                    trade.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">
                    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select&nbsp;&ldquo;Call&rdquo;&nbsp;if you think the price of the asset will
                    go above your entry price at the time of expiry.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">
                    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select&nbsp;&ldquo;Put&rdquo;&nbsp;if you believe the price will fall below
                    the entry price at the time of expiry.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit back and wait for the
                    outcome of the trade.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collect your profits if the
                    trade ends in-the-money.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Move on to the next trade
                    if it ends out-of-the-money.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>&nbsp;What are the advantages of Trading
                        Binary Options?</strong></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forex offer a simple way of
                    trading the financial markets. All you need to do is to assess the likely <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
                    direction&nbsp;of an asset&rsquo;s price over a certain period of time.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not have to worry
                    about hidden spreads, commissions or fees, as your risk and reward is clearly <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
                    displayed&nbsp;on the platform.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Binary Options contracts
                    can be purchased at any time of the day. This means that there is always an open<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
                    &nbsp;market&nbsp;through which you can derive profits.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can easily customize
                    your forex trading, because the assets expiry time, and investment amount<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
                    &nbsp;are decisions left to you.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market doesn&rsquo;t
                    have to make large moves for you to actualize decent profits. Even a single point in your
                    <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;favor&nbsp;is enough for a trade to end in-the-money and make you money.
